# Energy & Carbon Footprint Tracking in AI

{{ #aipr_header }}

## Why Measure Carbon Footprint in AI?

**Carbon footprint** refers to the total greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions caused by
an activity. In machine learning, large-scale model training consumes significant
energy, contributing to emissions.

### Why Track Energy & Emissions?

1. **AI’s Environmental Impact** – Large ML models require high computational power,
   leading to increased energy consumption.
2. **Optimization & Efficiency** – Identifying high-energy-consuming functions
   helps optimize and reduce resource waste.
3. **Regulatory & Compliance Needs** – Researchers, businesses, and policymakers
   aim to quantify AI’s carbon impact.
4. **Cost Reduction** – Efficient energy usage leads to lower operational costs.

Measuring AI’s energy consumption allows **better optimization, improved
sustainability, and transparency** in reporting emissions.

## How is Carbon Footprint Measured?

Measuring the carbon footprint of AI involves two main steps:

1. **Energy Consumption Measurement**
   Tools like [CodeCarbon](https://github.com/mlco2/codecarbon) use hardware
   sensors—such as Intel RAPL for CPUs and NVIDIA NVML for GPUs—to track power
   usage. We integrate power over time (kWh) to determine the total energy
   consumed during model training or inference.

2. **Carbon Emissions Calculation**
   The total energy (in kWh) is multiplied by the regional carbon intensity
   (gCO₂/kWh) to estimate emissions using the formula:
   `Total CO₂ Emissions = Energy (kWh) × Carbon Intensity (gCO₂/kWh)`

   _Where:_

   - **Energy** = Sum of hardware power usage over runtime
   - **Carbon Intensity** = Grid emission factor for the region

   For example, the Regional Carbon Intensity fetches location-based CO₂ per kWh
   data from public sources (e.g., [Ember Climate](https://ember-climate.org/)).
   It can auto-detect cloud provider regions (AWS, Azure, GCP) or use user-provided
   location.
